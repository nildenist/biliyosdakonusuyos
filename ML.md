 |Types of Learning|Supervised|Unsupervised|Semi-supervised|Reinforcement Learning|
 |---|---|---|---|---| 
 | **Dataset**| Collection of labeled examples|Collection of unlabeled examples|Collection of both labeled and unlabaled examples|-|
 |**Goal** |To use the dataset to produce a model that takes a feature vector x as input and outputs information that allows deducing the label for this feature vector|To create a model that takes a feature vector x as input and either transforms it into another vector or into a value that can be used to solve a practical problem.|The same as the goal of the supervised learning, using many unlabeled examples can help the learning algorithm to find  or to produce a better model.|To learn a policy.|
